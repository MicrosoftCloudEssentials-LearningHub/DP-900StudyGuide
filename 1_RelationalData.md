## Q: Understanding SQL Query Types

> For each of the following statements about SQL query types, select if the statement is correct.

- [ ] **A SELECT query can retrieve multiple columns from a table at once.** ✅: `This is correct because a SELECT query can specify multiple columns in its column list to retrieve several pieces of information from a table.`
- [ ] **An INSERT query can add multiple rows to a table in one execution.** ✅: `This is correct because an INSERT query can be used with multiple value sets to add several rows to a table in a single execution.`
- [ ] **A DELETE query removes all rows from a table without deleting its structure.** ❌: `This is incorrect because a DELETE query removes rows based on a condition but does not remove all rows without deleting the table structure; the TRUNCATE query is used for that purpose.`
