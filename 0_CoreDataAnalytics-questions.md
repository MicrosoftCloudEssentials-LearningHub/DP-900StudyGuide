| Type of Analytics | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| Descriptive       | Summarizes past data to understand `what has happened`. → `What happened?` |
| Diagnostic        | Analyzes data to understand `why something happened`. → `Why did it happen?`|
| Prescriptive      | Provides `recommendations` for actions based on data analysis. → `What should I do?`|
| Predictive        | Uses historical data to `predict future outcomes`. |
| Real-time         | Analyzes data as it is generated to provide `immediate insights`. |
| Cognitive         | Uses AI and machine learning to `simulate human` thought processes in data analysis. |

## Q: Understanding Descriptive Analytics

> Descriptive analytics tells you:

- [ ] what is most likely to occur in the future.
- [ ] what occurred in the past. ✅
- [ ] which actions you can perform to affect outcomes.
- [ ] why something occurred in the past.

## Q: Understanding Predictive Analytics

> Predictive analytics helps you:

- [ ] understand why something happened.
- [ ] summarize past data.
- [ ] predict future outcomes. ✅
- [ ] recommend actions to take.

## Q: Understanding Diagnostic Analytics

> Diagnostic analytics is used to:

- [ ] summarize past data.
- [ ] understand why something happened. ✅
- [ ] predict future outcomes.
- [ ] recommend actions to take.

## Q: Understanding Prescriptive Analytics

> Prescriptive analytics provides:

- [ ] summaries of past data.
- [ ] reasons why something happened.
- [ ] predictions of future outcomes.
- [ ] recommendations for actions. ✅

## Q: Understanding Types of Analytics

> You are working on a data project and need to choose the appropriate type of analytics for different scenarios. Match each scenario with the correct type of analytics: <br/>
> - Summarizing past sales data to understand trends. <br/>
> - Analyzing customer feedback to determine why sales dropped. <br/>
> - Predicting future sales based on historical data. <br/>
> - Recommending actions to increase future sales. <br/>

Which type of analytics should you use for each scenario?

- [ ] Descriptive, Diagnostic, Predictive, Prescriptive ❌: `This is incorrect because the order of analytics types does not match the scenarios provided.`
- [ ] Diagnostic, Descriptive, Predictive, Prescriptive ❌: `This is incorrect because the first two analytics types are not correctly matched with the scenarios.`
- [ ] Descriptive, Diagnostic, Prescriptive, Predictive ❌: `This is incorrect because the last two analytics types are not correctly matched with the scenarios.`
- [ ] Descriptive, Diagnostic, Predictive, Prescriptive ✅: `This is correct because Descriptive analytics summarizes past data, Diagnostic analytics analyzes reasons for past events, Predictive analytics forecasts future outcomes, and Prescriptive analytics recommends actions.`

## Q: Understanding Database Normalization

> For each of the following statements about database normalization, select if the statement is correct.

- [ ] **Normalization involves organizing data to reduce redundancy.** ✅: `This is correct because one of the primary goals of normalization is to reduce data redundancy by organizing data into related tables.`
- [ ] **Normalizing a database can improve data integrity.** ✅: `This is correct because normalization helps maintain consistency and accuracy in the database, thereby improving data integrity.`
- [ ] **Normalization eliminates the need for relationships between tables.** ❌: `This is incorrect because normalization does not eliminate the need for relationships between tables; instead, it organizes data into related tables with defined relationships.`
